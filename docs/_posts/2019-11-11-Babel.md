Babel Restaurant, which has the star of the red guide @michelinguide,
has been tempting the Degustująca Istota for a long time with its beautiful dishes presented on social media.
 Finally when it turned out that we will be in Budapest, we decided to step in and try the tasting menu there.
We chose a 10-course tasting menu in which Chef Istvan Veres presented numerous references
to his roots from Transylvania. Even Dracula got a dish inspired by legends about him.


### Degustation:

#### *Pickled grape leaves*

First Amuse-bouche. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />

#### *Red cabbage*

Fourth Amuse-bouche. Gorgeous. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />

#### *Asparagus/camomile/mustard/honey*

A very interesting dish. The leek surface is covered white asparagus with mustard and honey. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Squid/kohlrabi/lovage pesto/Smen*

Delicious, delicate squid in a perfect sauce.

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Quail sweatbreads/cucumber/fennel/snail eggs*

The first controversial dish. According to the "Zero waste" principle,
the Chef decided to use more of the quail, which is served as a main course.
Quail eggs were served, more specifically Mr. quail eggs XD .
I must admit that this ingredient was surprising and very tasty. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/ba_przep_1.jpg" alt="Cucumber slices wrapped on a plate
, cut lengthwise. Decorated with white balls of snail caviar and with fennel branches."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Beef tartare/pickled elderflower/horseradish snow/Lavash*

Delicious tartar surrounded by sour liquid, which gave it an excellent taste.
The horseradish snow provided sharpness and the Lavash crisps a bit of bitterness and a different texture.
 To be true, one of the
Degustująca Istota said that he prefers a less watered and more traditional tartare.
And he is a Tartare expert greater than I am.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Cucumber soup/cheese/dil/tomato*

Cold served cucumber soup made from fresh cucumbers. Refreshing and delicious.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Pike perch/swiss chard/asparagus/pine*

Another brilliant dish at the Babel restaurant.
Velvet pike perch, dipped in a delicious sauce. Under the grilled beetroot Chef hides amazingly cooked asparagus.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Dawn/apple sorbet*

Green apple sorbet with frozen mint, tarragon and basil leaves.
First served on a table frozen in liquid nitrogen herbs in a mortar,
which the Degustująca Istota was supposed to crumble on their own
(as you can see, it didn't go well). Then sorbet was applied on top of the herbs.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Quail/wild garlic/mushroom/apricot seed*

Very good main course,
though for the Degustująca Istota this view was macabre.
The meat was incredibly delicate and the sauces were wonderful.

<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/ba_przep_2.jpg" alt="Quail leg with claws.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Beef skirt/broccoli/gooseberry/horseradish*

For this dish,special hand-made knives were brought. Beef was very tasty, surrounded by an essential sauce.
A wonderful broccoli salad was served in a separate mug.

<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/ba_wolowina.jpg" alt="On the dark brown plate the piece of meat is lying.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Green walnut/yoghurt/potato/pumpkin seed*

A delicious pre-dessert. The Degustująca Istota could look at it endlessly.
It was a potato glass with very tasty creams. As the Degustująca Istota likes, it was not a sweet dessert.

<center><div style="width:85%">

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *The Rose*

The last dish from the menu, dessert. It had two secret ingredients that were revealed to us after we consumed it.
The dessert was a reference to Count Dracula who drinked blood.
The wafer under the cream was made of blood, and the whole dish was finished with grated charred pig heart.
It didn't shock us (it is hard for someone to be shocked by blood after eating quite a lot of black pudding in their lives).
But we were not convinced that
it had a positive effect on the taste of the dessert. In addition, the dessert consisted of sweet rose petals and grapefruit.

### Summary:

The evening at @babelbudapest was surprising, fun and very enjoyable.
It is hard to guess what miracles the Chef can still conjure up,
but this makes dinner not boring, even if not everything pleased us.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

The service was of the highest standard. The table was served by five or six different people, except for the main waitress,
who looked after us and talked about courses. Various Chefs also came to finish the meal at the table.
 The service was included in the bill and according to the Degustująca Istota it was justified.
Along with the bill, we received something sweet. Sweet, sugar glass pieces with sunk flower petals and tiny cream cakes.

in which pieces of glass of sugar are stuck. Next to it are cookies."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Sweet and traditional bread was served at the beginning of the dinner, along with three butters in different flavors.
Bread and butter were served again, after we ate the previous ones.

The prices in the Babel restaurant are adequate to the quality of the dishes and service in our opinion.
If the opportunity arises @degustujacaistota will gladly come back there.
We are happy to award the restaurant with the Happy Eggplant badge.
