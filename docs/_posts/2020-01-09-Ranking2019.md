The Degustująca Istota is&nbsp;One Year Old!
She learned a&nbsp;lot and tested a&nbsp;lot in that year.
She met many great Chefs, sometimes personally, sometimes only through their work.

Below The Degustująca Istota placed the best restaurants according to herself,
which she had the opportunity to visit last year.
The Degustująca Istota also distinguished the best dishes that she ate in her favourite restaurants.

### Summary:


It was a beautiful year. The Degustująca Istota thanks all Chefs and their teams and service in restaurants
for making her hobby so beautiful, for amazing experiences and for works of art she gets on the plate.
 And for the New Year 2020, she wish all Chefs and their teams,
 that it will be even better than the previous one and that your work would be appreciated.
 To you reader, admiration and thanks that you wanted to look here and all the best for the New Year!
  Selfishly, the  Degustująca Istota wants to get more time to describe the great dishes she ate,
   because many dishes worth immortalizing are not described here yet.
   Many thanks for brilliant technical support of the blog,
  to the author [Writeonly.pl].
