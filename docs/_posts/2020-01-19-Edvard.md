Degustująca Istota went to a nine course tasting dinner (in fact there were many more)
to the Edvard restaurant in Vienna at the Hotel @kempinskivienna.
The Chef there is Thomas Pedevilla. The Edvard restaurant has been awarded with the
@michelinguide star since 2014 and has 16 points in the @gaultmillau_austria.
We were greeted by very polite staff from the very beginning and it was extremely pleasant throughout the dinner.

### Degustation:

#### *Little rolls/butter*

Small but tasty potato rolls with coarse salt. They were served with butter, in the shape of cauliflower florets.

#### *Fake Garlic*

The first Amuse-bouche.
Garlic, which was not real garlic. It was a cream dipped in white unsweetened chocolate and placed on a mini focaccia.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Mushroom*

The second Amuse-bouche was a mushroom with an intense champignon flavor. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Sour soup with croutons*

The third Amuse-bouche was the sour soup. We tried to find out more, but we only know that it is a traditional
Austrian soup served with croutons and cooked meat. The soup was creamy and slightly sour. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_am_bo2.jpg" alt="Two bowls with small, colorful stones.

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Alpine Caviar/beef/Gillardeau Oyster*

A beautiful starter. Delicate oyster panna cotta, tartare and sturgeon caviar. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_oyster.jpg" alt="Two oyster shells. Cream mousse at the bottom of the shell,

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Bavarian Prawn/carrots/spinach*

A very carrot dish. Crunchy carrots and spinach dominated there. The dish was quite salty.
_3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_carrots.jpg" alt="Small carrots and spinach leaves arranged on a white plate.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Breton Sardin/eggplant/Puntarelle*

A signature dish. Crunchy Cicoria Asparago with tomato sauce and ravioli with eggplant filling.
Additionally, sardines in black tempura. Nicely composed dish. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_rav_sardines.jpg" alt="White stone cut into the shape of a plate,

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Périgord Trüffe/Sot-l ́y-laisse/red onion*

To this dish you could add, with a surcharge, a white truffle, which was brought in a beautiful glass box.
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_white_truffle.jpg" alt="Glass box with golden edges,
  inside three white truffles, on rice."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Of course, as truffle lovers, we couldn't refuse to have it as an addition to the course.
The delicate taste and aroma of white truffle, however, was somewhat lost in the intensity of the other flavors.
 The dish contained an imitation of a black truffle that had a truffle-flavored filling.
There were also pieces of poultry (Sot-l ́y-laisse), very delicate and soft, and sweet, pickled onions. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Loup de Mer/Razor Shell/Mignonette*

This dish brought us a lot of joy and pleasure.
Therefore, The Being awards this dish a Happy Eggplant badge. A beautiful, edible shell with a clam inside.
The shell imitated the original shell in which the Razor Shell lives. Perfectly cooked sea bass. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_fish.jpg" alt="In a deep white plate,

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Suckling Pig/Horn of Plenty/mozzarella*

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Fennel/saffron/grape*

Intermezzo. Slightly sweet, cool and refreshing.
A crunchy cookie was hidden inside and was decorated with champagne granita. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_intermezzo.jpg" alt="

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Sole/Chioggia Beet/Amalfi*

You could choose one of the main dishes. Because there were two of us, each of us chose a different dish to try both.
The fish version was very tasty with lemon sauce, which was well combined with a Sole fish and beets. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_sola.jpg" alt="

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Venison/sweet potato/radicchio*

The second main course was deer. Very delicate pieces of deer with sweet potato puree and radicchio lettuce.
The additions to this dish were a little too intense for us.
Very salty chips  with tartare and a second addition, very herbal and juniper flavors. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_venison.jpg" alt="
On the white plate are two, oval pieces of meat, poured with a dark sauce on orange puree.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Ice cream/fruit*

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Pumpkin/Opalys/curcuma*

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


### Summary:

It was a beautiful evening. The dinner took us 4 hours, but to be able to fully enjoy and ask for every detail
of the presented dish, you would have to spend another 2 hours there.
The dishes were very complicated and carefully made. The service was professional and friendly.
The staff willingly helped and asked about comfort. Except for the addition of white truffle,
no dishes were finished at the table,
 unlike the Babel restaurant in Budapest. It is a pity,
 because it was very nice and interesting. We were offered great champagne during dinner and at the end we got pralines with salty caramel,
chocolate truffles with hints of orange and macaroons.
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/edv_gift1.jpg" alt=" Two pieces of stone are placed on the stone: bright macarons,
semicircular pralines, cube-shaped chocolate truffles and macaroons."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

We thought that it was the end of surprises, but at the exit we were gifted with gingerbreads in a star shape,
which we were happy to crunch when we returned home.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

The price of the tasting menu was not low. But for a dinner in a restaurant with a Michelin star, during which many luxury products were served and for impeccable service, the price is high, but adequate to the quality. For that evening the Happy Eggplant Badge has been granted.
