To the Rozbrat&nbsp;20 restaurant  the Degustująca Istota wanted to go for almost a year.
 Fortunately, in December, a few days before Christmas, she made it.

The @rozbrat_20 restaurant is recommended by @michelinguide and @gaultmillaupolska. 
The Chef here is @bartszymczak, which serves surprising and elegant delicacies, which change depending on the season.
There are six seasons in the Rozbrat&nbsp;20. 
The Degustująca Istota had the pleasure of tasting the dishes from the lunch menu of season&nbsp;VI "Christmas Time".

The Rozbrat&nbsp;20 is one of six restaurants of the group called "Ferment Group". The Degustująca Istota 
visited another restaurant belonging to this group,
 the Butchery and Wine. But about this, I will write another time.

### Degustation:

#### *Kombucha*

Mulled beverage from kombucha. For the first time,
 the Degustująca Istota tried something like this and it was very good. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Bread*

Wheat and wholemeal bread was served. Both were delicious, warm and had a crunchy crust. 
In addition, two types of butter: cream and barley malt. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *A set of three Amuse-Bouches*

A beautiful amuse-bouche set. Puff pastry with sauerkraut and beef heart pastrami. 
Brioche with chicken liver pate and foie gras. Last but not least, apple and bison grass flavoured jelly beans. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Herring/apple/grape/cream*

Herring with grape pesto, slices of grapes and grape juice used in vinaigrette. 
Next to the herring a different version of it is placed, a herring salad. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Foie gras/duck heart/mulberry/brioche*

This dish was not on the lunch menu, but the Degustująca Istota could
not refuse it when seeing it in the menu card and she ordered the
tasting menu and this dish as an addition to the lunch. It was a great idea. The
course was amazing.  _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Borscht/smoked mackerel/mushroom/marjoram*

Borscht was served with mini ravioli, mushrooms and crispy beetroot pieces. 
One pair of ravioli contained ricotta and smoked mackerel, and the other contained mushrooms.
 The herbal taste of borscht was a little too intense in my opinion, but the ravioli were delicious.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Apple/pudding/cinnamon/puff pastry*

Dessert. An apple in several ways. The dessert was fruity and sweet, but not too sweet.
 A nice addition was the crunchy cookie and crumble. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/roz_deser.jpg" alt="

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


#### *Pralines*

At the end we got a beautiful Christmas gift box and tested excellent tinctures made by the Rozbrat&nbsp;20 restaurant.
 The sweets had flavors: salty caramel, truffle with orange, sunflower with cocoa and white chocolate. 
We liked the last praline the most. A very interesting combination. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Summary:

The Degustująca Istota and her companion were very pleased to be in the Rozbrat&nbsp;20.
 The lunch menu turned out to be very interesting and above all, consistent.
  The theme of winter and holidays appeared throughout all dishes. The presentation of the courses was amazing.
   Each dish had something interesting. Small details that made it interesting and that "something is happening" feeling. 
The service was friendly and fully professional.
 We can't wait to go to the Rozbrat&nbsp;20 restaurant for a tasting dinner.


For a perfect lunch and a wonderful Christmas atmosphere, the Degustująca Istota is happy to award
 the Rozbrat&nbsp;20 by Happy Eggplant Badge.
