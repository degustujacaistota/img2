Tempted by the beautifully sounding Valentine's menu, 
the Degustująca Istota with her Valentine went to the restaurant @fiorentina_krakow.
 The chef of Fiorentina Dom Polski is Robert Koczwara.
 The restaurant is recommended by the yellow guide @gaultmillaupolska, in which it received two chef hats.

The restaurant's decor is stylish and romantic. Perfect for Valentine's Day celebration.

#### *Foie gras/vanilla/figs/Chałka/hazelnut*

Creamy foie gras with vanilla, fig preserve and caramelized hazelnuts.
Served with slices of Chałka(sweet bread) fried in orange syrup.
A perfect combination. We will remember this foie gras for a long time. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Grapefruit sorbet/yogurt/dill*

Intermezzo, which did its job perfectly. Refreshing and tasty.
The cold sorbet was balanced by the yogurt sphere. Dill oil has also added smoothness and an interesting taste.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Caramel apple*

Due to allergies, we asked to change the dessert, which was originally a cheesecake. 
It turned out that thanks to this we got one of the most beautiful desserts we have ever seen.
 A beautiful, red apple with a diced apple inside and peach-hibiscus sorbet. Taste and presentation at the highest level. Wonderful.

### Summary:

What deserves special mention in the served dishes is the attention to detail. 
Beautifully designed and refined in every inch the courses were interesting and beautiful.
 Foie gras was definitely one of the best ones that we have eaten and have eaten a lot of them. 
 The dessert also gave us a lot of joy and satisfaction.
The only downside this evening was the service. The ladies were polite, but very busy,
 which made serving dishes and talking about them rushed and it was difficult to hear.
For a beautiful Valentine's evening and wonderful dishes, the Degustująca Istota awards the Fiorentina by the Happy Eggplant Badge.
