The mysterious Biały Królik (White Rabbit) restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Quadrille Hotel in Gdynia.
 The Chef here is Rafał Koziorzemski (@rafalchef__smaktowna) and the Chef Patron is Marcin Popielarz (@popek_52).

 Intrigued by the interestingly sounding "Follow the White Rabbit" menu, 
 the Degustująca Istota was tempted to visit this restaurant at the end of November last year. Unfortunately earlier
she didn't find time to describe this magical evening.

### Degustation:

#### *Own-baked bread/buckwheat crisp/chives butter/caramel butter*

From the beginning when the bread was served, we were transferred to the forest atmosphere.
 The bread was given in a circle of bark decorated with whole nuts and acorns.
  It pleased the eye and the palate. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Butter served in the form of charming balls,
 together with a buckwheat crisps. We would like more of these butters, because they were very good.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Snail/roasted garlic*

Beautiful and tasty amuse-bouche.  _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Duck tongue/pork rind/cranberry*

A bit controversial Amuse-bouche in the form of shashlik.
 It is worth to give it a try. It was crunchy and had a nicely composed flavor. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/bk_am2.jpg" alt="

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Potato salad with roasted herring and fried yolk*

Delicious herring accompanied with creamy egg yolk and potato salad. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Crumbed goat feta with sloe and roasted beetroot and jerusalem artichoke*

Nicely balanced and tasty dish. Very interesting coatings. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:65%">

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Cabbage soup cooked on smoked ribs with gherkin and macerated sturgeon*

Excellent essential soup with delicate sturgeon.
 Beautifully served and very tasty. The delicious, fall off the bone ribs were brought as the attachment to the soup. 
 The whole course nicely complemented itself.
The Degustująca Istota gives this Cabbage soup the Happy Eggplant Badge.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


#### *Pear/elderberry/green pepper*

 Extremely refreshing Intermezzo. Unfortunately, I don't like green pepper so it was quite difficult
for me to eat.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Wild boar cheek in horseradish sauce with red cabbage and marinated Sechna prunes*

The main course was wonderful. Soft, crumbling meat and crunchy red cabbage blended in perfectly with
Sechna prunes.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Chocolate cake with hazelnuts and roasted parsnip/sea buckthorn ice cream*

An interesting dessert that combined several textures. However, he was too sweet for me. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/bk_dessert.jpg" alt="On a flat white plate
lies a brown strip of mousse in which orange panes and dark brown chocolate sponges are stuck.

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Petits Fours*

Roasted rye/herb honey. Quince/juniper/pine. "Bajaderka". These are cute sweets,
 which resembled mushrooms growing in a forest.
_3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/bk_petits_fours.jpg" alt="On discs cut from the trunk of the tree and
 painted dark, are two pieces of every sweets: two black balls in a white paper from the bottom,
  two green balls and two halves of rye balls stuck together with honey."

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

### Summary:

The "Follow the White Rabbit" dinner was full of surprises. 
Courses perfectly matched the subject of forest and magic, what the Degustująca Istota liked very much.
They were also fancifully prepared and served.
 A large amount of work was put in to serve such interesting dishes.
At the end a great tincture was offered to us.
  
  Finding weaknesses, the service was sometimes quite cold and reluctant to answer questions about dishes.
  
It is worth adding that the entire hotel together with the restaurant has the rule that only those who are over 16 are allowed.
The Degustująca Istota doesn't see anything wrong with it, it's good that there are
 places where you can come with children and it's good that there are places where you can relax without them.

For this magical evening the Degustująca Istota awards the @bialykrolikgdynia by the Happy Eggplant Badge.
