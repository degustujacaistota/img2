Tian is a vegetarian Fine Dining restaurant in Vienna. And in fact this vegetarian
Fine Dining tempted us to try their eight-course lunch tasting menu.
Chef @paul_ivic is able to impress with his artistic dishes.
Tian was awarded the star of the guide @michelinguide and three toques of the guide Gault & Millau.

### Degustation:

#### *Crisp bread/rolls/butter/olive oil and rapeseed oil*

We liked the modern way of serving bread. The vials contained various olive oils as well as rapeseed
oil and salt. The butter was arranged in a rose shape and the rolls were still warm.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Brussels sprouts/onion*

First Amuse-bouche was served along with the bread.
It was Brussels sprouts, in the leaves of which a mini brussels sprouts salad was hidden. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

A wonderful, small donut with onion filling and onion chips was served with Brussels sprouts. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Crosne/salsify/almond*

The first time we had the opportunity to eat the crosne and it was very good.
Great composition of flavors and textures. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Red meat/red emmalie/radicchio*

Another beautiful dish. Both the description of the dish and the presentation resembled a traditional tartare,
but of course it was made from only vegetables. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_red_meat.jpg" alt="On a beige, rough plate

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Red corn/white corn/hogweed*

Hogweed soup was also eaten by us for the first time and was excellent.
An amazing soup was so aromatic and delicious that we would like to eat a whole pot of it. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_corn1.jpg" alt="Dark brown soup when pouring into a gray bowl."

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


As an addition to the soup the corn chips were served.

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Kale/celery/oyster mushroom*

A very celery dish. It consisted of two parts: main dish and salads. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_kale2.jpg" alt="A circle with is laid out on a white plate

  and breaded celery cubes."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Truffle pasta*

Yes! It was a brilliant course. Finally we were able to eat a dish with white truffle and it was perfect.
Nothing dominated the taste and smell of truffles.
Just as we love. The sauce further enhanced this taste.
We already miss this pasta. The Happy Eggplant badge is surely well deserved.

#### *Cookie & pear*

Beautifully served intermezzo. Cool ice cream, foam and a crunchy cookie. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Jerusalem artichoke/khorasan wheat/sorrel*

The main course also consisted of two parts.
The first part, finished at the table with a beautiful golden sauce. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_topinambur.jpg" alt="On the plate, bright disk of chopped vegetables,

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Schlossberger/parsley root/coffee grounds*

Crunchy dish, composed of chopped parsley root and cheese slices. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_schlossberger.jpg" alt="On beige, rough

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Red rice pudding/red & yellow beet*

A delicate and creamy pudding. Beautifully served. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_red_rice.jpg" alt="In a dark bowl with

 next to it is a red crispbread."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Sunny side up/coconut/mango/IPA*

It was one of the very few desserts that I ate entirely with taste.
A perfect dessert for me. And this is because the interior was filled with condensed, bitter IPA beer, which perfectly broke the sweetness of the other parts of the dessert.
It also looks phenomenal and sunny. For this beautiful and perfect dessert,
the Degustująca Istota gladly awards with the Happy Eggplant badge. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

### Summary:
What a fascinating experience. It turned out that Vegetable Fine Dining can be unusual
and above all very beautiful, at least in the Tian restaurant. Served dishes are art on the plate.
We could try many new flavors and plants that we have never tried anywhere else.

At the end we were treated with some beautiful petit fours.
