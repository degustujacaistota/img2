I never though that I would write this article in such sad circumstances,
 when the Villa Gardena has been closed. 
This is a huge loss for us, as well as for the entire Silesian culinary scene.
The Villa Gardena restaurant was also appreciated by the guide 
@gaultmillaupolska in which she received two toques.

Chef Dominik Duraj has proved his talent to us many times and prepared dishes that we will remember for a long time. 
For an example, a brilliant potato cream with fresh truffle, which was 
our first dish at the Villa Gardena restaurant and from which we absolutely fell in love in this place.
  There was also a guinea fowl served at Fine Dining Week. The best prepared guinea fowl,
   from those we had pleasure to eat.

Not all delicious dishes have been described on the Degustująca Istota blog,
that's why I will allow myself for 
a bit too long article today to mention some of those which didn't have the opportunity to be there before.

The day before the restaurant closing we were at Villa Gardena on Fine Dining tasting dinner. 
In the darkest thoughts we didn't think
 that it will be our last dinner in this beautiful place.


### Degustation:

#### *Kimchi/fennel/nasturtium*

Amuse-bouche, which perfectly suited our taste. Crunchy, sweet and sour. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Avocado/homemade curd/pine nuts/horseradish mayonnaise/nasturtium/lime*

Beautiful and tasty appetizer. Creamy avocados fit perfectly to cottage cheese.
 The whole dish was seasoned with horseradish and lime. We liked the dish so much,
that we awarded it the Happy Eggplant Badge. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Scallops/dashi from trout/apple/micro herbs/saffron*

Delicate scallops in saffron sauce. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Octopus/sepia/parsley oil/parsley root*

Excellent, delicate octopus on black risotto with sepia. As an addition,
 parsley confit in butter and parsley oil. This is another dish that delighted us,
  which is why we will grant it by the
Happy Eggplant badge. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Passion fruit /mango*

A refreshing intermezzo. Tasty sorbet. Not too sweet. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Honey cake/lemon sorbet/pecans/honey*

A delicious dessert in which the sweetness of the cake was balanced by the sourness of the lemon sorbet. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:65%">

that this is the last such dinner, we award the Villa Gardena restaurant by the Happy Eggplant Badge.
