During the last Fine Dining Week we stepped in to the La Rotisserie restaurant in Warsaw. 
The chef of La Rotisserie is Artur Grajber, whom we had the pleasure to meet in person.
 After tasting, the chef came to talk to guests about the dishes and hear their opinions. 
 We were very glad about that.
 
 
La Rotisserie has the @michelinguide and Gault & Millau recommendations.
This elegant restaurant is housed in the beautiful interiors of the @mamaisonlereginawarsaw hotel building.

### Degustation:

At the beginning the different types of bread has been served.

#### *Duck/foie gras/hazelnuts/quince/pear/ginger/cherry oil/cranberry*

Dried duck breast beautifully presented and delicious.
 Because it is our custom to come to Fine Dining tasting a bit too early,
 we additionally ordered a starter from the a la carte menu.
 It was great and that's why we gave it the Happy Eggplant Badge. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Deer/goose liver ice cream with boletus/amber cheese/mustard/mushroom powder with mustard*

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Scallop/prawn/turbot mousse/tomatoes*

Excellent fish soup. Delicate scallops and prawns in essential cream. 
This soup delighted us so much that we also award it the Happy Eggplant Badge. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Wagyu (Urugwaj)/roasted leek/scorzonera/truffle potatoes*

Main course. Perfectly prepared Wagyu beef, delicately truffle puree and intense roasted leek.
 We are not meat fans, but this dish was sensational.
  Of course, the Happy Eggplant Badge is obvious in this case. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Summary:

The entire tasting menu was on a very high level. There were no weak dishes, which do not happen very often.

Perhaps you are wondering that the restaurants
 on this blog have such high marks and virtually everyone receives the Happy Eggplant Badge.
 The explanation is very simple. With a limited amount of time to write articles,
  I choose the best restaurants that are worth remembering and describing.
  I am reluctant to write about bad dinners, which also happen to us.

Yes! Because of this delicious Fine Dining dinner La Rotisserie obviously deserved the Happy Eggplant Badge.
 We can't wait to get back here again.
