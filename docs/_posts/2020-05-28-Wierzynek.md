The Wierzynek is a cult place and famous all over Poland. 
A stay in this historic restaurant gave me the idea of ​​a new tag on the "Degustująca Istota" website, namely "Luxury restaurant".
This is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about @wierzynek_restauracja. 
Beautiful, historic interiors, tastefully decorated and a special, rich tableware.
Prices are also among the highest that we have seen so far in Poland.

Together with others Degustujące Isoty, we finally decided to test what good you can eat at a Fine dining dinner
 in Wierzynek and the Fine Dining Week festival was perfect for that.

### Degustation:

#### *Salted herring/Sherry/cherry/beetroot/“Łąckie” apple*

Very good, light herring appetizer. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Foie gras/sękacz/duck demi-glace/currant/forest fruits*

Sękacz (traditional Polish spit cake) with foie gras played very nice. 
We award this dish with the Happy Eggplant Badge for this interesting combination. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Saddle of venison/Jerusalem artichoke/broad bean/chanterelle mushroom/parsley/blackberry*

 The main course was served in a very attractive way. It made a great impression on us.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Zucchinni flower/vegetable ratatouille/goat cheese/zuchinni/kale/beetroot/vegan demi-glace*

After the menu from Fine Dining Week we decided to check other dishes from the main menu in Wierzynek.
 Zucchini flower on the menu is so rare that we could not refuse it. However, it was a flat and heavy dish. _2&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/wie_flowers.jpg" alt="Zucchini flowers in dough, next to a clear puree,
 demi-glace sauce and pieces of beetroot and cauliflower."

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Smoked beef tartare/sous vide egg yolk/pearl onion/truffle/porcini mushroom/caper/lovage*

Smoked tartar was beautifully presented at the table.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Tasty tartare with a smoky aroma, well seasoned. Unfortunately the truffle was not palpable. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Honey-caramelized  porcini mushroom ice cream/chocolate & nut ground/black currant sauce*

A lovely ice cream dessert in the shape of a mushroom. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Summary:

It was definitely a special evening. To be a guest in such a beautiful place is a great pleasure.
The service tried very hard and you have to admit that they did it great.
 They were wonderful, despite the high occupancy of the restaurant. Oddly enough, the service fee was not added to the bill, 
 which, however, we were happy to make up.
