I was planning to visit the Epoka restaurant already in March, but the pandemic prevented it.
Finally, when @restauracjaepoka again opened its doors to guests I decided to achieve this goal.
The Chef at the Epoka restaurant is @przybyszmarcin, who gained experience cooking alongside such famous Chefs as Massimo Bottura,
Rasmus Kofoed or René Redzepi. No wonder the expectations were enormous.

The moment you enter the restaurant, you can see how every detail is thought out and refined. The decor is magical,
 in some places, dark and charming in others, but elegant and coherent all the time.

Together with other Degustujące Istoty , we decided on 20 recipes menu, but traditionally without wine pairing.

### Degustation:

#### *Bread/Butter*

Delicious sourdough bread made of płaskurka grain, ground in the restaurant.
A separate butter with buttermilk from Normandy was served for every person. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Recipes inspired by a cookbook from 1825

#### *Asparagus with sauce*

Beautifully composed both from a visual perspective and the taste one. An asparagus grid hid crab meat.
The whole dish was decorated with crab sauce and topped with wonderful sturgeon caviar.
 We give the dish the Happy Eggplant badge with appreciation. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

This dish was served in the kitchen, where we could admire the work of the whole team and learn a little more about it.

and filled with tasty white asparagus ice cream with a green strawberry flower. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Recipes inspired by a cookbook from 1926

#### *Boiled turbot with sauces*

Boiled turbot with excellent smoked white asparagus with asparagus sauce,
 wild asparagus and currant assiette. The currant brilliantly matched the turbot and asparagus,
  and everything was complemented with smoked taste. For this reason I need to award it with the Happy Eggplant badge.

<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Ep_turbot.jpg" alt="Setted on a deep white plate

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

### Recipes inspired by a cookbook from 1682

#### *Foam*

I rarely appreciate desserts because they are generally too sweet.
This one was excellent. The sweetness of white chocolate was broken with sour cream,
 lime pebbles and sorrel sorbet.
 I am happy to award the dessert the Happy Eggplant badge. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Ep_foam.jpg" alt="
In a wide white bowl with a wavy edge lies a white portion of cream sprinkled with white chocolate.
Next to it lies a dark green sorbet. White lime pebbles are crushed around."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Melchmus/Spinach cake*

The rhubarb Melchmus(legumin) with pieces of rhubarb and a beautiful spinach cake from a siphon.
Incredibly fluffy and decorated with flowers.
To this dish yogurt sorbet was added. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Ep_dessert.jpg" alt="Various white dishes arranged tightly.
On the leaf-shaped plate lies white sorbet decorated with blue flowers.
On the second platter there are 3 green waffles decorated with flowers. There is a red, thick compote in the small jug.
 Rhubarb rings with red balls are arranged in a hemisphere on the largest flat plate."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Wety*

At the end of the dinner there are still small sweets. Polish macaroon, mini opera cake, fermented raspberry praline,
raspberry jelly, cake with salty caramel. I liked the cake and the praline the most.
Interestingly, Wety were served not all for every person. We needed to split them,
as Chef Marcin said, to feel not fully satisfied and come back again for more. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Ep_wety.jpg" alt="On a white plate that looks like it
larger plates are broken, small sweets lie. Flower-shaped cake with brown filling between layers of dough,
pink jellies in sugar, white chocolate praline with red-orange pattern, brown Polish macaroon
with a gold paint stripe on top and a layered mini opera."

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


### Summary:

After assessing the dishes and the number of badges awarded to them, you can already guess that it was the best dinner we had the pleasure to test. Apart from the fact that it was delicious, beautiful and at a high level, it was simply a pleasant evening, nice and fun. We felt really welcome.
It may be strange, but with a stiff classic Fine Dining it's difficult to maintain professionalism and elegance,
 and at the same time be nice and free. In the Epoka it succeeded. It was indeed the Fun Dining, but it was no worse than the Fine Dining.

In addition, because I informed during booking that one person does not eat some products, other versions of the recipes have been prepared.
What was very nice, they were not poorer versions, but equally laborious and of similar value as the original dishes on the menu.
Of course, the Order of the Happy Eggplant is well deserved for this wonderful tasting dinner.

Chef Marcin Przybysz eagerly talked about dishes and how the restaurant was created,
about the contribution to its creation, about his inspiration from the old recipes of Polish cuisine
(to which the tasting menu referred that evening).
Thanks to the kindness of the Chef, we were able to admire the work of the whole team and what is happening in the kitchen.
 Amazing experience. It was difficult to focus on food, seeing with what precision dishes are prepared,
  how efficiently and with commitment the whole team works.

The desserts made by sous-chef @rafpastrychef were like a fairy tale and even
someone that is not a fan of sweets, could enjoy them. In addition, Chef Rafał Gajownik in a wonderful way told us about them.

I will just mention a very innovative approach to photos in @restauracjaepoka.
As you can see, some photos are made in the so-called light box.
This is a specially constructed box with the perfect light for taking photos of dishes.
 Just ask for them and you can freely professionally photograph these small works of art created by Epoka's team.

Downsides? I have not found one. Maybe that we would like even more recipes, or that I don't live in Warsaw.
