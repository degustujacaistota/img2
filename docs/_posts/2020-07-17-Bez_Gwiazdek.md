Another visit to the restaurant recommended by the @michelinguide and there is something to celebrate again. 
To celebrate the birthday of a friend of Degustująca Istota, Degustująca Istota was invited to the restaurant @bezgwiazdek,
 where the Chef is Robert Trzopek @roberttrzopek.
  I've been thinking about visiting this restaurant for a long time, but somehow it didn't happen before.
Bez Gwiazdek is a small restaurant with only a few tables.
The atmosphere is more homely than restaurant-like and the service seems relaxed as well.

The menu changes once a month and focuses on the region of Poland selected for that month.
We stepped in for a menu inspired by dishes from the West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

### Degustation:

#### *Bread*

Several types of bread served with butter and rapeseed oil. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Fish broth/young vegetables/rose*

Turbot broth with the addition of roasted butter was very substantial and rich in flavor.
It was nicely enriched with pieces of zucchini and asparagus.
Pickled rose petals were a surprising and delicious complement to the whole dish.
  Also visually, this dish made a great impression. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

### Summary:

At Bez Gwiazdek restaurant, dinner was very tasty, although it must be admitted that the menu for June
 was not exactly tailored to our tastes.
We are not big fans of fish, especially a birthday boy who does not eat fish at all and chose vegetarian versions.
Unfortunately, we are not in Warsaw as often as we would like and
 after all, we wanted to try the chef's authors dishes.
 
I think the evening was very enjoyable and I'm glad we got to know the minimalist and less formal approach to Fine Dining.
