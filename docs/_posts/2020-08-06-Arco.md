Normal people go to the seaside to swim, sunbathe, and relax.
We went to the Tri-City for excellent meals and we were not disappointed.


Apart from the fame of the Chef himself,
we were tempted to visit Arco by Paco Pérez by the beautiful
view from the 33rd floor of the Olivia Business Center building in Gdańsk.

The restaurant makes an amazing impression, both by the view and the interior design.
The kitchen is open and connected to the dining, which I love because I'm always enormously curious about the magic that happens there.

The chef at Arco is Antonio Arcieri.
We chose the "20 ideas" menu, which has a quote of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's "The Little Prince":
"All adults were once children ... but few of them remember it." After such an introduction, we hoped not only for excellent cuisine but also for fun.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Bread/olive oil*

At Arco, bread appeared after the amuse-bouche series, which was an interesting change, because we usually got it first after placing the order.
We had a choice of several types of bread and we could try two wonderful olive oils.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;



#### *Beef tenderloin with apple*

Wagyu beef pieces with tapioca, apple and nuts, and marrow flan. For me, the beef was a bit too tough,
and the addition of marrow made it a heavy dish. But it looked very beautiful and we got
to this dish very nice special knives. _2&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/arco_wagyu2.jpg" alt="A photo of the table with the main beef dish.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


#### *Petit fours*

Those were surprise eggs inspired by Salvador Dali. Each one has a different taste so that we could tell each other what we have eaten.
As this concept never suits us, we shared them anyway. Which was not easy, because some
of them had a liquid filling. Fortunately, we were forewarned about this. I only remember the raspberry flavors.
It was fun, even if we didn't stick to the rules and I am happy to awarded the badge for this unusual idea. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/arco_eggs.jpg" alt="Black plate with egg slots. 4 small eggs are placed there:
two brown, green, and white with a golden addition."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

### Summary:

I admit that it was fun and the cuisine was great too. Maybe not everything was 100% to my liking, but the dishes were tasty and wonderfully presented.
What I liked the most was the perfect presentation of the dishes and an amazing view.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Interestingly, there was no stiff atmosphere that we were a bit afraid of. The evening was nice, relaxed and at times funny.
The service, which was almost flawless, also deserves recognition.

For a special evening with a beautiful view, I am happy to award the Arco restaurant with the Happy Eggplant Badge.
