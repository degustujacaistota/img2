For the second time we visited Vienna with a culinary tour and this time we decided to reach the top shelf
and try a tasting dinner in restaurants with two and three @michelinguide stars.

As a two-star restaurant, we chose Silvio Nickol restaurant, that is the Silvio Nickol Gourmet Restaurant,
which is located in Palais Coburg.

In front of the entrance, of course, there was a plaque with information about two Michelin stars award and,
that restaurant is a member of the luxurious Les Grandes Tables du Monde.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

We were led to a beautiful, elegant dining room. With impressive,
an illuminated wall of amethysts used as a background for a big, white egg.
The egg also appeared in other places of the restaurant and as it turned out, it was the leitmotif of both the dinner,
and the entire restaurant. It was named "The egg of Origin".
It is supposed to refer to philosophical questions about the beginning of existence and our fragility in relation to the surrounding universe.

### Degustation:

#### *Cucumber/Char roe/dill*

Light and refreshing amuse-bouche. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Si_am1.jpg" alt="In a transparent glass bowl, there is

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


#### *Buffalo tartare/tarragon*

Another amuse-bouche. Tartlets with tartare seasoned with tarragon. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Si_buffalo.jpg" alt="Small tartlets with tartare are placed on the bone,

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Pork belly/carrot*

Next amuse-bouche. Crispy carrot was beautifully composed with bacon in teriyaki sauce.
Very interesting was the way we were supposed to eat this snack. For this purpose we got chef's tweezers. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Si_pork_belly.jpg"     alt="In a white, small bowl there is a piece of bacon covered with dark sauce. On top of it there are crispy, thin, striped carrots."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Bread*

Bread on sourdough with a crispy crust. Served warm. We had two types of butter for the bread:
with roasted onion and chives. Both were excellent and creamy, although I liked the chives butter more. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Si_bread.jpg" alt="A loaf of bread cut into four parts,

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Sturgeon/coconut/apricot/verbena/salicornia*

A brilliant, silky sturgeon in a coconut milk marinade with a little sweet apricot,
intensive, herbal verbena oil and chili. This composition definitely deserves the Happy Eggplant Badge. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

In the vegetarian version, chopped fennel was served instead of sturgeon. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

#### *Duck liver/mushroom/spruce/chocolate*

This dish delighted all of us. As it turned out it was a signature dish of Chef Silvio Nickol.
Beautiful forest where there were mushrooms and acorns formed from liver mousse,
that looked real. In addition, chocolate bark, edible moss probably from pistachio, but I'm not sure.
 There were also real marinated mushrooms.
 This forest full of surprises, that we discovered while eating, will remain long in my memory.
  Perfect and delightful! Of course it gets the Happy Eggplant Badge.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

For liver mousse we got a beautiful mushroom-shaped brioche. It was a perfect fit for this dish.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Blün Catfish/leek/jerusalem artichoke/turnip cabbage/caviar*

The beautiful main course, which delighted with its appearance and taste.
The fish was made in a barbeque marinade, smoked, and grilled.
It had compact but delicate meat. The sauce made of white asparagus was smooth and perfectly matched the catfish.
Small tubes decorated with caviar and flowers were a great addition. Another impressive dish,
 to which I gladly award the Happy Eggplant Badge. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Surprise egg*

Refreshing intermezzo served in liquid nitrogen vapour.
A ceramic egg was placed in front of us, and then its upper part was removed, releasing the fumes of nitrogen
and showing another egg filled with gazpacho with celery, tomatoes, and cream. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Both the way this gazpacho was served to us,
as well as the taste and structure, they definitely deserve the Happy Eggplant Badge.  _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Truffle/ polenta/quail egg*

Maybe this dish was not visually the most beautiful, but the taste and consistency were wonderful.
The most fluffy and creamy polenta I ate.
 Apart from thick slices of truffles, there were also pieces of truffles inside.
  A summer truffle from Istria was used here. I love truffles, very much,
  and polenta was an excellent carrier of truffle taste and aroma.
  And yes! This dish also gets the Happy Eggplant Badge. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

 I really like this very interesting dessert with vegetables.

### Summary:

A sensational evening. Almost every dish evoked a "wow" reaction from us.
The flavor compositions were perfectly suited to our taste and the size of the portions was also excellent.
There were plenty of surprises during the dinner. The dishes were worked out to the smallest detail.
The intricately arranged details were impressive.

The service was perfect and the tempo of the dishes served was appropriate for us,
because often by taking pictures our dinner is slightly longer than the standard time.
I will never forget many of these dishes and I hope that one day we will come back to Silvio restaurant for another great feast.

Naturally, for this amazing, top level fine dining dinner, I award the restaurant the Happy Eggplant Badge.

At the end, we had the pleasure to meet the Chef and the whole crew, and have a few words with them.
It is an honor to meet someone who can prepare such a brilliant menu, which enchanted us.
