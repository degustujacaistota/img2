It is not easy to write a summary for a year that was so cruel for the world's gastronomy and especially for Fine Dining restaurants as last year 2020.
Despite notorious lockdowns, we managed to eat in several excellent restaurants in Poland 
and in Vienna, including the five that are awarded with the @michelinguide stars.
There were some great plans to visit Germany and Sweden, but unfortunately they have to wait for better times.

Below are two lists of restaurants that charmed us in 2020. 
The first list includes restaurants where we were for the tasting menu and the second one where we tried a la carte courses.

The awarded restaurant's description also contains the dishes that delighted us and links to articles 
(if I managed to write them, some are still waiting for their turn).
The restaurants on the lists are placed alphabetically.

#### Bottiglieria1881 (Cracow)

<br />

#### Epoka (Warsaw)

<u>Chef: Marcin Przybysz</u>

The Degustująca Istota has managed to be at the Epoka restaurant twice this year.
 In our opinion it is definitely one of the best restaurants in Poland. 
 Excellent service and original, creative cuisine is addictive. 
 If circumstances allow us we would be in Warsaw every month to try the new Epoka menu.

<br />

#### Isto (Katowice)

<u>Chef: Patryk Dusza</u>

This restaurant is very special for us, because, in a way, our Fine Dining adventure began with it. 
 The year 2020 was not easy and at one point the Isto without the Chef Patryk lost its shine, but fortunately, it regained it. 
 We can't wait to sit in the Isto again and try the tasting menu.

[More about visit in Isto restaurant]

#### La Rotisserie (Warsaw)

<i>Michelin Guide Plate</i>

Friendly Chef and excellent meals. We hope to return to La Rotisserie quickly.

#### Silvio Nickol Gourmet Restaurant (Vienna)

<i>Two Michelin stars</i>

<u>Chef: Silvio Nickol</u>

It was a fabulous dinner which we will not forget for a long time.
 It was difficult to pick the best dish here because there were so many great dishes we ate in this restaurant.
  We also had the pleasure to meet the Chef personally while he was working in the kitchen, which was a fantastic experience.

<br />

#### Tian (Vienna)

<i>One Michelin star</i>

<u>Chef: Paul Ivić</u>

It was a beautiful adventure.
 Vegetarian Fine Dining at the Michelin star level is something we have long been looking for, and we are hoping that there will be more such places in the future.

[More about visit in Tian restaurant]

The best course: Truffle pasta

<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/tian_truffle.jpg" alt="Pasta spaghetti with white sauce

<br />

#### Villa Gardena (Chorzów/Katowice)

Unfortunately, Villa Gardena is now closed.

 We are very sad that such a fantastic place is no longer available in Silesia.

[More about visit in Villa Gardena restaurant]

<center><div style="width:63%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/vg_octopus2.jpg" alt="Tentacle of octopus on a black risotto.

</div></center>
<br />

## The Best Restaurants - a la Carte


#### Mercato (Gdańsk)

<u>Chef: Paweł Stawicki</u>

We visited Mercato twice in 2020, once at lunchtime and a second time for breakfast. Both visits were very satisfying.

The best course: Homemade linguini pasta with sous vide and fried turbot. Sauce from champagne and shrimps.

<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Mer2020_linguine.jpg" alt="In a black shiny plate lies a coiled linguini. There are two pieces of turbot and baby spinach leaves on the pasta."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />

#### Plado and Umami (Gliwice and Pyskowice)

<u>The chefs in the sister restaurants are: Mateusz Bieniek and Robert Biniasz</u>

We managed to visit the Plado and Umami restaurants several times last year, but we used their take-out offer much more often, and in both forms, they did not disappoint us. 
 Although the Fine Dining in delivery is an almost impossible thing, 
 it was nice to eat something from the "top shelf" when there was no opportunity to visit the restaurant.

The best course: Ostrich tartar / pickled asparagus / creamy yolk / green onion
<center><div style="width:50%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Plado_ostrich_tartare.jpg" alt="Tatar with ostrich with pieces of asparagus and yolk."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />


#### Prologue (Gdańsk)

<u>Chef: Wojciech Korfel</u>

The one such place. The prologue is unique not only because of the stunningly good steaks from Wagyu,
 but also splendid desserts. We already miss these specialties.
[More about visit in Prologue restaurant]

The best course: Wagyu steak
<center><div style="width:50%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Pro_wagyu2.jpg" alt="On a wooden board lies a sliced steak."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />

#### Sacher Restaurant Rote Bar (Vienna)

<i>Michelin Guide Plate</i>

<u>Chef: Dominik Stolzer</u>

In 2020 we visited the famous Sacher hotel twice. The first time was in January at breakfast, 
which naturally ended the Sacher Torte and the second time in August,
 when we decided to visit the Restaurant Rote Bar and it was an excellent idea. 
[More about visit in Restaurant Rote Bar restaurant]

The best course: Original Sacher goose liver tarte with elderberry, apricot and hazelnut brioche.
<center><div style="width:50%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Sacher_foie_gras.jpg" alt="On an oval, white, flat plate there is 
a piece of goose liver pate tart, in the middle, on an orange square of jelly there is a portion of elderberry 
and a gold-plated ball also made of goose liver. On the opposite side of the grate there is a small bun sprinkled with pieces of hazelnuts. In the background a beautiful restaurant with a gold-plated mirror on the wall."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />

#### Signature (Warsaw)

<i>Michelin Guide Plate</i>

<u>Chef: Wojtek Kilian</u>

We try to visit Signature at least once a year
 because we like this restaurant very much. Peace of mind, delicious food and great service with Mr. David in the lead. 

The best course: Octopus/potato/tomato/avocado/lemon mayonnaise

<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Signature_octopus.jpg" alt="On a white plate there are two pieces of octopus lying on top of each other with a dark green cone. Next to it there is a portion of brown sauce."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />


#### Śląska prohibicja (Katowice)

<u>Chef: Magdalena Nowaczewska</u>

It took some time before we decided to visit the Śląska Prohibicja.
 I must admit that the delay was caused by very difficult parking in Nikiszowiec. 
 Indeed it can be difficult to find a parking spot there, but it is worth it. 
 In the menu there is something for the lovers of Silesian traditional dishes, but there are also other interesting menu positions. 


The best course: Guinea fowl breast / mashed potatoes / asparagus / brown champignon/ roasted chicken sauce
<center><div style="width:65%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Sl_proh_guinea_folw.jpg" alt="On a bright, flat plate lies a stuffed guinea fowl's leg. Next to it is a portion of puree with green asparagus, mushrooms and sugar peas shoots on top. The whole is poured with baking sauce."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />

#### Villa Vienna (Bytom)

<u>Chef: Roman Miś</u>

In Villa Vienna the Wiener Schnitzel is worth a sin 
(especially with potatoes with vinegar and onions).
 Also the goose feast was wonderful, the sensational goose legs, fillet and liver made our November gloomy days more pleasant. 
All of these courses we got delivered to our home due to the national lockdown.
 However, the best dish was a great halibut, 
 which we managed to eat on the spot in the restaurant during a short break between lockdowns.

The best course: Halibut with sweet potato fries.
<center><div style="width:50%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Vv_halibut.jpg" alt="On a flat, blue plate lies a coated piece of halibut
and in a melted basket of sweet potato fries. On the plate there is also a bowl with a salad with cocktail tomatoes."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />

### Summary:

I admire Chefs, restaurateurs and the whole restaurant service for fighting, for not giving up even though the year was extremely hard and the next one does not look any brighter. 
 I can only wish you courage and determination, and thank you for this effort.

I wish you, dear guest, so you can have opportunity to enter your favorite restaurants as soon as possible
 and enjoy delicious food and great company.
  In the meantime, support the local gastronomy, 
  order take-away and delivery food, publish positive comments and be good to yourselves 
  so that we all survive somehow this strange, anxious time.
