[Fine Dining] is the best way for us to spend birthdays. After all, when if not on your birthday, you can allow yourself a little luxury.
This October evening was very special to us as we celebrated Mom's birthday.
So we opted for one of our favorite fine dining restaurants in Silesia, the Isto restaurant (@restauracjaisto)
with Chef Patryk Dusza (@chefpatrykdusza) in the lead.

The view from the Isto restaurant to the Spodek.

### Degustation:

#### *Bread*

First we were offered a variety of breads.
These included slices of sourdough bread and flatbreads.
The breads were served with delicious butter with salt and sensational truffle espuma.

<br />

#### *Tomato [consommé]*

Tomato consommé of red tomatoes with olive oil. Beautifully served and very good. Perfect for the autumn mood. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />

#### *Mackerel/fennel/smoked cheese*

Another [amuse-bouche]. A piece of mackerel with fennel and cheese, garnished with flower petals. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />

#### *Beef/goat cheese/buttermilk*

Great tartare with goat cheese granita. It was so good that we came for it again a few days after the tasting dinner.
Of course I award it the Order of the Happy Eggplant. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Isto2020_tartare.jpg" alt="In a dark, glossy, deep plate lies a portion of tartare covered with white chunks of frozen cheese." height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Sunflower/sheep cheese/black chanterelle*

Crunchy sunflower seeds, soft mushrooms and intense sheep cheese. A perfectly composed risotto,
which also delighted me with its beautiful, dark colors, garnished with yarrow and wood sorrel.
 By all means, a Happy Eggplant badge is due for this offbeat dish. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Pike-perch/red pine mushroom/Parmesan*

Delicate pike-perch with baked crust accompanied by ravioli with truffle and fried red pine mushrooms.
The whole dish was complemented by a cheese sauce. Of course, the Order of the Happy Eggplant is well deserved for this wonderful composition and perfect preparation.. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Isto2020_fish.jpg" alt="In a gray, flat plate with a high edge lies a piece of white fish with the skin baked up. Next to the fish there are hats of fried red pine mushrooms and two ravioli.
 The whole dish is covered with a thick white sauce and drizzled with green olive oil."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Duck/[Kaszanka]/apple*

Our friend, who does not like fish, got duck instead of pike-perch for the first main course.
It was duck with Kaszanka in panco with the addition of ash.
Topped with a thinly sliced apple and also a cheese sauce. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:70%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Isto2020_duck.jpg" alt="In a gray, flat plate with a high edge lies a piece of duck fillet and Kaszanka in a black coating.

  There are spots of red sauce next to the meat."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *[Mizeria]*

A great [intermezzo] in the form of Mizeria ice cream served on crumbled meringue. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Isto2020_intermezzo.jpg" alt="A green ice cream served with white meringue crumbs on a small white plate."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Bacon/potato/onion*

For the second main course, we were served a classic combination that did not disappoint.
Sensational bacon! Served with potato pudding, [demi-glace] sauce, onion and pickled cucumber.
 The next Order of the Happy Eggplant for a brilliant dish goes to Isto. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Chocolate/raspberry/lime*

Pre-dessert. Chocolate ice cream with dried chocolate and raspberries. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Isto2020_predesser.jpg" alt="In a dark mortar lie sheets of chocolate
and under them you can see a portion of chocolate ice cream and raspberry jam laid on top of the ice cream. The chocolate sheets are dusted with cocoa."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Blueberry/juniper/red cabbage*

Excellent [puff]. This was the second time we had the pleasure of eating [choux au craquelin] at Isto and I'm slowly getting addicted to them because they are just delicious.
This one was served with red cabbage ice cream, which I have to say, was one of the best ice creams I've ever had.
They enter the pantheon of the best ice creams along with the rose ice cream from Prologue restaurant which you can read about [here].
Of course, both the puff and the ice cream deserve the Order. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Isto2020_dessert1.jpg" alt="On the table lie white tea cups and a large white
flat plate with a puff in the middle. The puff lies on rolled up baking paper. It is sprinkled with red powder on top.

<br />&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;

### Summary:

Dinner was at an excellent level and there were no shortage of surprising items, such as ice cream with Mizeria and cabbage.
It was also our first time eating black chanterelle, which turned out to be very tasty.

The restaurant staff brought Mom a birthday candle in a puff at the end of dinner, which was very nice.


The evening was completed by a beautiful fountain, which can be admired by the building of [NOSPR].

Naturally, Isto Restaurant and Chef Patryk Dusza received the Happy Eggplant Badge from us for a beautiful dinner and a pleasant evening.

Currently, Isto restaurant remains closed due to Covid pandemic restrictions,
but you can order Easter specials there until 31.03.2021, which I have already done and I recommend.
