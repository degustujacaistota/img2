It took us a long time to start our sushi adventure in a serious way.
 We had ordered sushi sets for work or home, but it was never fine dining.
Following Kamila and Cezary's (@finediningpl) recommendation we decided to go to the Omakase show at Noriko Sushi restaurant in Wroclaw.
 And it was a great choice.

The Chef and Sushi Master at Noriko Sushi restaurant (@sushinoriko) is Marcin Jasiura (@marcinjasiura), 
Chef serves so-called Tokyo style sushi, which is: opposite each other. 


### Degustation:


#### *Marinated daikon radish*

To cleanse our taste buds between courses we got daikon, 
which was perfect for me because I'm not a fan of pickled ginger.
Or at least the kind you get traditionally at most sushi restaurants.

#### *Sashimi with ponzu*

Sashimi from cefal fish topped with freshly grated wasabi and ponzu. 
The wasabi came from Shizuoka prefecture in Japan. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Eggplant*

A perfect, melt-in-your-mouth appetizer made from eggplant, yuzu, miso, soy sauce, spring onions and lemon zest.
 I am happy to award this appetizer the Happy Eggplant Badge. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Sashimi from leek*

Baked salmon on a brilliant, melt-in-your-mouth leek topped with wasabi.
 Another well-deserved Order for this leek appetizer. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### * Grilled Skrei Cod*

Great crispy crust and tender fish. Topped with Okinawa salt, fresh wasabi and lime. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


#### *Risotto*

Sensational risotto with Ikura (salmon roe marinated for 5 days in a special marinade of sweet sake and soy sauce) and fatty part of tuna. All seasoned with soy sauce and chives. 
 This delicious risotto, of course, receives the Happy Eggplant Badge from us.

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Nigiri*

The time has come for nigiri. The Sushi Master prepared portions of fish and seafood and served them to us with rice and the appropriate sauce.
This excellent rice was from Niigata Prefecture and was cooked sensationally.
We never had the opportunity to eat such delicious rice in our lives.

Specialties prepared for serving.
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Nor_nigiri_set.jpg" alt="On a large board are prepared 3 pieces of each type of fish or seafood."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


For starters, there was probably greater amberjack. 
I'm writing "probably", because we sometimes talked so much with the Chef and the Chef's wife,
 that we forgot to write down what we ate and, unfortunately, memory is fleeting. I only remember that it was delicious. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


Tenderloin of bluefin tuna. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


Steamed squid. This was a difficult dish for us. 
The calamari was as tender as we had ever experienced. 
Perhaps we even associated its texture more with pudding than meat. However, it had a strange, soapy, sweet flavor. 
Total taste shock, I guess we still need to grow into it. _2&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Semi-fat tuna part with soy sauce. _4&nbsp;[eggplants]._

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


Mackerel with a mixture of ginger and spring onions on top. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

Shimofuri, which is the fatty part of the tuna without any veins, aged for a week, seasoned with Arashio salt from Okinawa. 
Sensational! This nigiri melted in the mouth and tasted great. Of course, the Order of the Happy Eggplant is deserved. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


Scottish salmon with sauce, also had great flavor. The Happy Eggplant Order is well deserved! _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


The aforementioned Ikura and Canadian salmon. It can't be another way around - another Happy Eggplant Badge! _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">

height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;


Jabara, fatty part of tuna with veins, aged a week plus Umeboshi sauce.
 I'm already repeating myself, but it was brilliant! There was so much umami in this one piece that you could go crazy.
  Everything was perfect, the sauce, the texture, the flavors...  Of course the next Order for this compelling nigiri! _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">

<br />&ensp;&ensp;


Nigiri with shrimp cooked for one minute. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">

</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Unadon*

After the delicious pieces of nigiri, it was the eel's turn. When I heard about the grilled eel, I had been waiting for it all evening. The eel was previously cooked in tare sauce, 
which matures for a second year and "works" just like sourdough.
The eel was obviously quite fatty but also phenomenally delicious! The aroma of this dish was also wonderful.
 It was worth the wait. The Happy Eggplant Badge flies to the delightful eel. _5&nbsp;[eggplants]._

<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Miso*

A light soup cooked on langoustine heads and shrimps with bonito, egg, and wakame. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._

 with chives floating on top."
height="200px" width="40px" />
</div></center>
<br />&ensp;&ensp;

#### *Dessert*

Last but not least, something sweet. A shrimp omelet that resembles a sponge cake. _3&nbsp;[eggplants]._
<center><div style="width:85%">
<img src="{{site.img_url}}/assets/img/posts/Nor_sponge.jpg" alt="Two pieces of omelet on a thick black ceramic stand."

### Summary:

It was a beautiful evening in Wroclaw. We laughed a lot, relaxed and ate delicious Japanese dishes.
 The recommendation was very good and we also encourage you to go for an Omakase to Noriko,
  because it is an unforgettable experience.  
The word Sushi takes on a whole new dimension. 

Naturally we award Noriko Sushi, Order of the Happy Eggplant, for this fantastic presentation of Omakase.

We are certain that this was not our last Omakase and not our last visit to Noriko Sushi. 
Rather, this is just the beginning of our love affair with fine sushi.
